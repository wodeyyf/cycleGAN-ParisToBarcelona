# cycleGAN-ParisToBarcelona

The object of this machine learning research is cycleGAN, currently the hottest in the field of architecture. 2019, Harvard Stanislas Chaillou's GAN-based housing layout research has had a very important impact on the field of architectural computing. He launched ArchiGAN, which led the way for the entire architectural AI research, and image-based generative design for architecture is still an absolute hot topic to this day.
However, since there has been a lot of research in the field of GAN-based architectural AI, I simply learned how to use GAN through the example of building façade style migration without further publishing it as a paper.
